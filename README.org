* RubyNEAT Examples for SB
** Examples
*** beaconline
    This is a simulation of doing RSSI locationing using
    beacons. It is meant as a proof of concept.

*** xor
    Basic neural net test for functionality. This is the one exampled used in the
    documentation at: http://rubyneat.com/wiki/Documentation

*** xorall
    This exercise (nearly) all of the CPPN neuron types.

*** xoranalog
    This tests represents the XOR function as an analog function.

*** xorsin
    Solves the XOR problem using the Sine and Cosine Neurons.
    This converges very fast with normally no hidden layers.

*** invpend
    Pole Balancing (ongoing, not ready yet)
** Stuff
   Let's see how LaTeX work here.
   \begin{equation}
     \gamma=\sqrt{\kappa}
   	 =\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\
   1&0\end{pmatrix}

   If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2/a \), then the solution must be
   either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].
